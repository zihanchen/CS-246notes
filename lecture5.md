##Source-code Management

####Source-code management software can help
- track changes to software code (program files) overtime
- backout of changes 
- maintain multiple versions(branches)
- provide a mechanism for multiple developers to work on the same code base simultaneously
- shared access to the same physical file is dangerous
- merging changes from different developers can be tricky
